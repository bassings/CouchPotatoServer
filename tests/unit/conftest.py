"""Shared fixtures for unit tests.

On Python 3.10, `patch('couchpotato.api.addApiView', create=True)` fails because
`couchpotato.api` resolves to the `api = {}` dict (imported into couchpotato.__init__)
rather than the api module. This conftest ensures addApiView is patchable by replacing
the problematic patch targets with direct module-level mocks.
